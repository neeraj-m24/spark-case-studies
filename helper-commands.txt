The error indicates that parquet does not support the Update output mode in streaming. This is a known limitation because parquet files are immutable. To resolve this issue, you can use one of these approaches:

Option 1: Use Append Mode
Change the output mode in the streaming query from Update to Append:

scala
Copy code
val query = updatedMetrics.writeStream
  .outputMode("append") // Change Update to Append
  .format("parquet")
  .option("path", "gs://your-bucket-name/path/to/real_time_metrics")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "gs://your-bucket-name/path/to/checkpoints")
  .start()
This will write only new rows to the output, but you must ensure you handle duplicate data during reads (e.g., using a primary key or deduplication logic).
